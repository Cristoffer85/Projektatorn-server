 * docker-compose.yml creates the docker-compose (rabbitMQ) directly to Docker desktop from which there it is manually started. 
 No need for kubernetes or CLI-tunnel in between to docker minikube.

Just start in Docker desktop, then run spring boot application and it automatically connects in between.
